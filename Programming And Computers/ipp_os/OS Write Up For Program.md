## Creating My Own Operating System

Have you ever wondered what goes on behind your computer screen? Well, your computer operates with the help of a tiny silicon chip known as the CPU (Central Processing Unit). This chip performs basic operations like addition and subtraction on numbers stored in memory, which is your computer's efficient high-speed storage. These operations happen frequently enough to keep your apps running smoothly. However, the CPU cannot do this alone and requires an operating system (OS). The OS informs the CPU when programs can run, where they can run, and where they should be stored. Additionally, the OS controls your peripherals (keyboard, mouse, etc.) and instructs the CPU to display letters on the screen. The OS also performs many other vital functions.
